# Perceptron Implementation in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Perceptron neural network in Python. The perceptron is a binary classifier and has been trained on logical OR data. It uses a step activation function and is capable of learning through the perceptron learning rule.

## Features

- Simple Perceptron implementation
- Trained on logical OR dataset
- Supports training with adjustable learning rate
- Step activation function

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vallz0/perceptron-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd perceptron-python
```

3. Run the `main.py` script:
```bash
python main.py
```
The perceptron will be trained on the logical OR dataset, and predictions will be tested after training.
